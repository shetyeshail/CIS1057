Computer Programming in C
  computer consists of hardware and software
    hardware includes all tangible components of a computer
    solftware is intangible (operating system, applicaitons)
  understanding hardware helps us understand software

Hardware
  most computers have similar components
    input
    processor
    memory
    output

Memory
  memory holds
    programs
    data for the computer to process
    the results of intermediate processing
  two kinds
    main
    auxiliary

Main memory
  working memory which stores
    the current program
    the data the program is using
    the results of iintermediate calculations
  referred to as RAM (Random Access Memory)

Auxiliary Memory
  referred to as secondary memory
  includes media such as disk drives, dvds, flash drives, etc
  more of less permanent (nonvolatile)
  usually measured in high gigabytes (eg 500gb hard drive)

Units of Storage
  a bit is a value either 0 or 1
  byte is 8 bits
  a kilobyte is 1024 bytes
  a megabyte is 1024 kilobytes
  a gigabyte is 1024 megabytes
  etc.
  byte is smallest amount of info that can be referenced in memory by address

Data Storage
  modern computers store data as bytes in memory
  a byte can represent a single characgter
  eacy byte is memory is represented by an address
  a computer will continuously read data from and write data to various memory locations during the execution of a program

Software
  software are collections of related instructions that are stored in memory and executed by the CPU
  each line is an instruction to the processor
  instructions must be in the language of the processor (machine language)

High-Level Languages (HLL)
  machine language is hard for humans to understnad
  programmers write prorams in high level languates (BASIC, C, Java, Prolog)
  a program written in a HLL is called source code
  source code ins translated to machine language by a compiler

Compilers
  a compiler translatees a program from a HLL to low-level machine language
  the result of compiling source files is object files
  object files are then linked to become an executable file
  many times, HLLs require a different compiler for each type of computer or operating system
